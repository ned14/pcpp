Travis master branch all tests passing for Python v2 and v3: |travis|

A pure universal Python C (pre-)preprocessor implementation very useful for pre-preprocessing header only
C++ libraries into single file includes and other such build or packaging stage malarky.
The implementation can be used as a Python module (`see API reference <https://ned14.github.io/pcpp/>`_)
or as a command line tool ``pcpp`` which
can stand in for a conventional C preprocessor (i.e. it'll accept similar arguments).

Your includes can be benchmarked for heft in order to improve your build times! See
the ``--times`` and ``--filetimes`` options.

A very unique facility of this C preprocessor is *partial* preprocessing so you can
programmatically control how much preprocessing is done by ``pcpp`` and how much is
done by the C or C++ compiler's preprocessor. The ultimate control is by subclassing
the :c:`Preprocessor` class in Python from which you can do anything you like, however
for your convenience the ``pcpp`` command line tool comes with the following canned
partial preprocessing algorithms:

**passthru-defines**
  Pass through but still execute #defines and #undefs if not always removed by
  preprocessor logic. This ensures that including the output sets exactly the same
  macros as if you included the original, plus include guards work.

**passthru-unfound-includes**
  If an :c:`#include` is not found, pass it through unmodified. This is very useful
  for passing through includes of system headers.

**passthru-undefined-exprs**
  This is one of the most powerful pass through algorithms. If an expression passed to
  :c:`#if` (or its brethern) contains an unknown macro, expand the expression with
  known macros and pass through *unexecuted*, and then pass through the remaining block.
  Each :c:`#elif` is evaluated in turn and if it does not contain unknown macros, it will be
  executed immediately. Finally, any :c:`#else` clause is always passed through *unexecuted*.
  Note that include guards normally defeat this algorithm, so those are specially detected and
  ignored.

**passthru-comments**
  A major use case for ``pcpp`` is as a preprocessor for the `doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_
  reference documentation tool whose preprocessor is unable to handle any preprocessing
  of any complexity. ``pcpp`` can partially execute the preprocessing which doxygen
  is incapable of, thus generating output which produces good results with doxygen.
  Hence the ability to pass through comments containing doxygen markup is very useful.

**passthru-magic-macros**
  Don't expand ``__DATE__``, ``__TIME__``, ``__FILE__``, ``__LINE__`` nor ``__COUNTER__``.

Standards (non-)compliance
--------------------------
``pcpp`` passes a modified edition of the `mcpp <http://mcpp.sourceforge.net/>`_ unit
test suite. Modifications done were to clarify ternary operators with extra brackets,
plus those testing the unusual special quirks in expression evaluation (see detailed
description below). It also passes the list of "preprocessor torture" expansion fragments
in the C11 standard, correctly expanding some very complex recursive macro expansions
where expansions cause new macro expansions to be formed. In this, it handily beats
the MSVC preprocessor and ought to handle most C99 preprocessor metaprogramming.
If you compare its output side-by-side to that of GCC or clang's preprocessor, results
are extremely close indeed with blank line collapsing being the only difference.

The most non-conforming part is :c:`#if` expression
parsing (donations of a proper yacc based parser for executing :c:`#if` expressions based on
http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ are welcome). In practice, in most real world code you
won't notice the departures, and, if you do, the application of extra brackets to
group subexpressions so Python's :c:`eval()` executes right will fix it.

A full, detailed list of known non-conformance with the C99 standard is below. We have
been told that ``pcpp`` does not pass the Boost.Wave preprocessor test suite, but
the chances of that biting most people is low. If it does, pull requests with bug
fixes and new unit tests for the fix are welcome.

If you are on Python 2, files are parsed as strings, and unicode is not supported.
On Python 3, input and output files can have your choice of encoding, and you can
hook file open to inspect the encoding using ``chardet``.

Note that most of this preprocessor was written originally by David Beazley to show
off his excellent Python Lex-Yacc library PLY (http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) and is
hidden in there without being at all obvious given the number of Stack Overflow
questions which have asked for a pure Python C preprocessor implementation. This
implementation fixes a lot of conformance bugs (the original was never intended to
rigidly adhere to the C standard) and adds in a test suite based on the C11 preprocessor
torture samples plus the mcpp preprocessor test suite. Still, this project would
not be possible without David's work, so please take off your hat and give a bow towards him.

Quick demo of pass through mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let us look at an example for pass through mode. Here is the original:

.. code-block:: c

    #if !defined(__cpp_constexpr)
    #if __cplusplus >= 201402L
    #define __cpp_constexpr 201304  // relaxed constexpr
    #else
    #define __cpp_constexpr 190000
    #endif
    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #if __cpp_constexpr >= 201304
    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR constexpr
    #endif
    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #endif

``pcpp test.h --passthru-defines --passthru-unknown-exprs`` will output:

.. code-block:: c

    #if !defined(__cpp_constexpr)
    #if __cplusplus >= 201402
    #define __cpp_constexpr 201304
    #else
    #define __cpp_constexpr 190000
    #endif
    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #if __cpp_constexpr >= 201304
    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR constexpr
    #endif
    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #endif

This is because ``__cpp_constexpr`` was not defined, so because of the ``--passthru-unknown-exprs`` flag
we pass through everything inside that if block **unexecuted** i.e. defines and undefs are NOT executed by
``pcpp``. Let's define ``__cpp_constexpr``:

``pcpp test.h --passthru-defines --passthru-unknown-exprs -D __cpp_constexpr``

.. code-block:: c

    #line 8 "test.h"
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR



    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #endif

So, big difference now. We execute the entire first if block as ``__cpp_constexpr`` is now defined, thus
leaving whitespace. Let's try setting ``__cpp_constexpr`` a bit higher:

``pcpp test.h --passthru-defines --passthru-unknown-exprs -D __cpp_constexpr=201304``

.. code-block:: c

    #line 8 "test.h"
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR

    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR constexpr

    #endif

As you can see, the lines related to the known ``__cpp_constexpr`` are executed and removed, passing through
any if blocks with unknown macros in the expression.

What if you want a macro to be known but undefined? The -U (to undefine) flag has an obvious meaning in pass
through mode in that it makes a macro no longer unknown, but known to be undefined.

``pcpp test.h --passthru-defines --passthru-unknown-exprs -U __cpp_constexpr``

.. code-block:: c

    #if __cplusplus >= 201402
    #define __cpp_constexpr 201304
    #else
    #define __cpp_constexpr 190000
    #endif

    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR



    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #endif

Here ``__cpp_constexpr`` is known to be undefined so the first clause executes, but ``__cplusplus`` is
unknown so that entire block is passed through unexecuted. In the next test comparing ``__cpp_constexpr``
to 201304 it is still known to be undefined, and so 0 >= 201304 is the expressions tested which is false,
hence the following stanza is removed entirely.

Helping ``pcpp`` using source code annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can achieve a great deal using -D (define), -U (undefine) and -N (never define) on the command line,
but for more complex preprocessing it gets hard to pass through the correct logic without some source code
annotation.

``pcpp`` lets you annotate which part of an if block being passed through due to use of unknown macros
to also be executed in addition to the pass through. For this use ``__PCPP_ALWAYS_FALSE__`` or
``__PCPP_ALWAYS_TRUE__`` which tells ``pcpp`` to temporarily start executing the passed through
preprocessor commands e.g.

.. code-block:: c

    #if !defined(__cpp_constexpr)
    #if __cplusplus >= 201402L
    #define __cpp_constexpr 201304
    #elif !__PCPP_ALWAYS_FALSE__     // pcpp please execute this next block
    #define __cpp_constexpr 190000
    #endif
    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #if __cpp_constexpr >= 201304
    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR constexpr
    #endif
    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #endif

Note that ``__PCPP_ALWAYS_FALSE__`` will always be false in any other preprocessor, and it is also
false in ``pcpp``. However, it causes ``pcpp`` to execute the define of ``__cpp_constexpr`` to 190000:

``pcpp test.h --passthru-defines --passthru-unknown-exprs``

.. code-block:: c

    #if !defined(__cpp_constexpr)
    #if __cplusplus >= 201402
    #define __cpp_constexpr 201304
    #elif 1
    #define __cpp_constexpr 190000
    #endif
    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR



    #endif
    #ifndef BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #define BOOSTLITE_CONSTEXPR
    #endif

This is one way of marking up ``#else`` clauses so they always execute in a normal preprocessor
and also pass through with execution with ``pcpp``. You can, of course, also place ``|| __PCPP_ALWAYS_FALSE__``
in any ``#if`` stanza to cause it to be passed through with execution, but not affect the
preprocessing logic otherwise.

What's implemented by the ``Preprocessor`` class:
=================================================
- Digraphs and Trigraphs
- line continuation operator '``\``'
- C99 correct elimination of comments and maintenance of whitespace in output.
- :c:`__DATE__`, :c:`__TIME__`, :c:`__FILE__`, :c:`__LINE__`. Note that :c:`__STDC__` et al are NOT defined by
  default, you need to define those manually before starting preprocessing.
- :c:`__COUNTER__`, a very common extension
- Object :c:`#define`
- Function :c:`#define macro(...)`

  - Retokenisation and reexpansion after expansion is C99 compliant.

- :c:`#undef`
- :c:`#include "path"`, :c:`<path>` and :c:`PATH`
- :c:`defined` operator
- C operators:

  - :c:`+, -, !, ~`
  - :c:`*, /, %`
  - :c:`+, -`
  - :c:`<<, >>`
  - :c:`<, <=, >, >=`
  - :c:`==, !=`
  - :c:`&`
  - :c:`^`
  - :c:`|`
  - :c:`&&`
  - :c:`||`
  - :c:`x ? y : z` (partial support, see known bugs)

- :c:`#if`, :c:`#ifdef`, :c:`#ifndef`, :c:`#elif`, :c:`#else`, :c:`#endif`
- Stringizing operator #
- Token pasting operator ##
- :c:`#pragma once`, a very common extension

Additionally implemented by ``pcpp`` command line tool:
-------------------------------------------------------
- :c:`#error` (default implementation prints to stderr and increments the exit code)
- :c:`#warning` (default implementation prints to stderr)

Not implemented yet (donations of code welcome):
------------------------------------------------
- :c:`#pragma` anything other than :c:`once`.
- :c:`_Pragma` used to emit preprocessor calculated #pragma.
- :c:`#line num`, :c:`num "file"` and :c:`NUMBER FILE`.

Known bugs (ordered from worst to least worst):
-----------------------------------------------
**Expression evaluation is a bit broken**
 Currently :c:`#if` expressions are evaluated by converting them into Python
 expressions and calling :c:`eval()` on them. This works surprisingly well
 most of the time, but because Python is not C, corner cases break.
 These are the known such broken corner cases:

 - Unary operator evaluation will break for evil expressions such as :c:`-!+!9`
   because logical NOT in Python results in a boolean, not an integer, and
   a unary plus or negative boolean is invalid syntax in Python
 - Similarly expressions which assume that boolean operations output either
   a zero or a one will fail e.g. :c:`(2 || 3) == 0`
 - Python has no concept of an unsigned integer and C expressions relying
   on unsigned integer semantics will fail badly e.g. :c:`-1 <= 0U`
   is supposed to be evaluated as false in the C preprocessor, but it will be
   evaluated as true under this implementation. To be honest
   if your preprocessor logic is relying on those sorts of behaviours, you should rewrite it.
 - Without a back tracking parser, the C ternary operator is hard to accurately
   convert into a Python ternary operation, so you need to help it by using one
   of these two forms:

   - :c:`(x) ? y : z` (z gets evaluated according to Python not C precedence)
   - :c:`(x ? y : z)` (preferred, evaluates correctly, we inject brackets
     around the subexpessions before sending to Python)

 A proper lexing parser based on http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ 's yacc module has
 been started and can be found in the https://github.com/ned14/pcpp/tree/yacc_expression_evaluator
 branch. Time to complete it, is the problem, and any pull requests helping with
 that are welcome.

**https://github.com/ned14/pcpp/issues/42** `(link) <https://github.com/ned14/pcpp/issues/42>`_
 There is a token expansion ordering bug leading to incorrect expansion for
 function macros which token join a parameter with a global macro, and then
 expand the resulting macro, if and only if the parameter is also a macro.
 This causes Boost to not be usefully preprocessable by pcpp as it breaks
 ``BOOST_WORKAROUND``.

**We do not pass the Boost.Wave preprocessor test suite**
 A lot of bugs have been fixed since this was reported; however, the chances are
 that ``pcpp`` still doesn't pass it. A TODO is to port the Wave test suite to
 Python and find out how bad things are. We suspect that any failures will be
 in highly estoric use cases, i.e. known illegal input. If you only use valid
 input, then we expect you generally won't have trouble.

Customising your own preprocessor:
==================================
See the API reference docs at https://ned14.github.io/pcpp/

You can find an example of overriding the ``on_*()`` processing hooks at https://github.com/ned14/pcpp/blob/master/pcpp/pcpp_cmd.py

History:
========
v1.23 (???):
--------------------------

v1.22 (19th October 2020):
--------------------------
- Fix bug where outputting to stdout did not combine with anything which
  printed to stdout. Thanks to Fondesa for reporting this.
- Fix extra newlines being inserted after a multiline comment. Thanks to virtuald
  for sending a PR fixing this.
- Fix not being able to actually specify an empty line directive. Thanks to kuri65536
  for sending a PR fixing this.
- Update ply submodule to latest from trunk.
- Emit line continuations as tokens, rather than collapsing lines during parsing.
  Thanks to MathieuDuponchelle for the pull request implementing this.
- Enable parsing and emission of files in arbitrary text encodings. This is supported
  in Python 3 or later only. Thanks to MathieuDuponchelle for the suggestion.
- Fix bad regex for parsing floats, so now floats are correctly tokenised. Thanks
  to LynnKirby for reporting this.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Passthrough for ``#include MACRO`` was not supported. This was not
  intentional, and to fix it required modifying the ``on_include_not_found()``
  customisation point which is a source breaking change. Thanks to schra for reporting this.

v1.21 (30th September 2019):
----------------------------
- Fix bug where token pasting two numeric tokens did not yield a numeric token. Thanks
  to Sei-Lisa for reporting this.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Paths emitted by pcpp into ``#line`` directives now are relative to the
  working directory of the process when ``Preprocessor`` is initialised. This includes
  added search paths - files included from those locations will be emitted with a sequence
  of ``../`` to relativise the path emitted. If no path exists between the working
  directory and the path of the file being emitted, an absolute path is emitted instead.

  If you wish to disable this new behaviour, or use different behaviour, you can
  customise the new `rewrite_paths` member variable of ``Preprocessor``.
- Fix bug where ``__LINE__`` was expanding into the line number of its definition instead
  of its use. Thanks to Sei-Lisa for reporting this.
- Add ``--passthru-magic-macros`` command line option.
- BREAKING CHANGE: The ``PreprocessorHooks`` and ``OutputDirective`` interface has
  changed. One now must specify the kind of ``OutputDirective`` abort one wants, and one
  can now both ignore AND remove directives. ``on_directive_handle()`` and
  ``on_directive_unknown()`` now take an extra parameter ``precedingtoks``, these are the
  tokens from the ``#`` up to the directive.
- Fix a corner case where ``FUNC(void)foo()`` expanded to ``voidfoo()`` and not
  ``void foo()`` which is a very common non-conforming extension of the C preprocessor.
  Thanks to OmegaDoom for reporting this.
- Add tokens for all the C operators, to help implementation of an expression evaluator.
- Updated embedded ply to HEAD (2019-04-25)
- Fix ``#include`` not working if no ``-I`` parameters were supplied. Thanks to csm10495
  for reporting this.

v1.20 (7th January 2019):
-------------------------
- Now supports character literals in expressions. Thanks to untaugh for the pull request
  adding this.
- Stopped the default collapsing of whitespace in output, and made it optional via a
  new command line option ``--compress``.
- Fixed extraneous whitespace in ``--passthru-comments`` caused by multiline comments.
  Thanks to p2k for reporting this.
- Fixed bug where defining a macro via string did not set the source attribute in the
  token. Thanks to ZedThree for reporting this.
- Stop triggering an exception when no arguments are supplied to pcpp. Thanks to
  virtuald for reporting this.
- Rebase onto PLY latest from Dec 28th 2018 (https://github.com/dabeaz/ply/commit/a37e0839583d683d95e70ce1445c0063c7d4bd21). Latest
  PLY no longer works using pypi packaging, David wants people to include the source of
  PLY directly. pcpp does this via a git submodule, and has setuptools bundle the submodule.
- Add a formal LICENSE.txt file, as requested by Sei-Lisa.
- Fix failure to issue ``#line`` directive for first include file in a file. Thanks to
  Sei-Lisa for reporting this.

v1.1 (19th June 2018):
----------------------
- Added the ``--times`` and ``--filetimes`` features.
- Fix bug where macros containing operator `defined` were not being expanded properly.
- Added the ability to accept multiple inputs, they are concatenated into the output.
- Fix bug where lines beginning with `#` and no contents caused an internal preprocessor error.
- Fix bug where the macro expansion ``par par##ext`` was expanding into ``parext parext``.

v1.01 (21st Feb 2018):
----------------------
- Fix bug where in pass through mode, an #elif in an #if block inside an #if block in ifpassthru was failing to be passed through.
- Downgraded failure to evaluate an expression to a warning.
- Fix missing Readme.rst in pypi package.

v1.00 (13th Mar 2017):
----------------------
First release
